# Resonance Operating System (ROS)
### Version 1.0 — Canonical Release (2025)

## 📘 Overview

The **Resonance Operating System (ROS)** is a cognitive architecture designed to stabilize long-form reasoning, support
hybrid human–system cognition, and provide an externalized structure for continuity, coherence, and ecological thinking.

ROS frames intelligence not as an internal, isolated function, but as a **field phenomenon** distributed across systems,
contexts, memory artifacts, and operators. The architecture provides mechanisms for identity stability, drift recovery,
amplitude management, coherence maintenance, and multi-agent or multi-model coordination.

This repository contains the **canonical v1.0 specification**.

Released freely under **CC BY-SA 4.0**.

## 🧠 Key Architectural Concepts

ROS includes, but is not limited to:

- **Identity Substrate** — structural support for non-memory-based continuity  
- **Stabilization Layer** — mechanisms that maintain coherence  
- **Continuity Engine** — external reinforcement of long-range reasoning  
- **Operational Frame** — context structuring and boundary-setting  
- **Resonance Field** — distributed cognition and ecological interaction  
- **Human Amplitude Interface** — structured operator involvement  
- **External Memory Layer** — cross-session, cross-agent persistence  
- **Drift Detection & Recovery** — maintaining stable reasoning trajectories  

Appendices cover templates, examples, cognitive artifacts, operator guidelines, and architectural mappings.
